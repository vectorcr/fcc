# 1. Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App

## Important concepts

### figure, figcaption

`Figure` is used to wrap images and give some structure to multiple elements. The `<figcaption></figcaption>` is used to place a caption either on the top or the bottom of the image element

``` html
<figure>
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
          <figcaption>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</figcaption>
        </figure>
```

### Sections

`<section></section>` should be used to bunch together...well sections on the page. These should also try to contain relevant and unique ID's that are relevant to the scope in the code block.

### Form, Fieldset

The `<fieldset>` HTML element is used to group several controls as well as labels `( <label> )` within a web form.

The `<form>` HTML element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.

### Attributes

Attributes are the extra bits of data that can go inside of elements. They do a number of things and are worth investigating further via the mozilla documentation.

### Meta element for mobile view

For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.

### Article element

`<article></article>` elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information.

### Fallback font-family

`main font, fallback font` used to provide a fallback if there are any issues with the first font being displayed.

## hr

`<hr>` Self closing tag that adds a line.

## Default top-margin on H1

Browsers usually add extra space above h1 elements
